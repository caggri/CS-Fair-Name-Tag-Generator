# CS Fair Name Tag Generator

This script will give the necessary files to generate automatic namet ags for CS Fair by using Adobe Illustrator*.

# What do you need to use this script?

Just Adobe Illustrator and a web browser.

# How to use?

• As the first step prepare a name list in spreadsheet and export it as CSV file. Be careful, the script is using semi-column as the delimiter and do not add anything but names and surnames.

• Upload the CSV file to the website. The website will give you the script that you need for creating the nametags and the necessary nametag template.

• Download template and script from the download links.

• Open Adobe Illustrator and select “Other Scripts” from “File” > “Scripts” >
“Other Scripts”

• Select “script.jsx” from the dialog box popped out. After that Illustrator asks the template file select “template.ait”. Do not minimize Illustrator while it is working. After Illustrator finishes its task it will ask a folder to save nametags as PDF file format.
